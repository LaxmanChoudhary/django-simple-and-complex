# django-simple-and-complex
would be adding links to different blogs that helped me out to understand some concepts of django.

### first step
make sure to go through the [django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/) before proceeding any further.

### the django bible
[Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/)

> Django documentaion is itself a great well documented documentation, to know everything about django. But why not use some help from the coummunity!!

### base layout

### django ORM
- [Basics of ORM -django girls](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/dynamic_data_in_templates/)
- Django official docs
  - [ORM](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/queries/)
  - [Queryset API](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/models/querysets/#django.db.models.query.QuerySet.exists)

### User authentication
- [Implement multiple user types](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2018/01/18/how-to-implement-multiple-user-types-with-django.html)
- [Extend/change user model](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/07/22/how-to-extend-django-user-model.html)
- Default User model on [Django Github](https://github.com/django/django/tree/stable/3.1.x)

> Search through **django > contrib > auth** to find out the user model. Not only User but the repo can be used to reference different models and classes to make use of them or customise them as per the need.
The latest releases are quite abstracted, to find a complete model, that was available as *single class* [here](https://github.com/django/django/blob/ff6ee5f06c2850f098863d4a747069e10727293e/django/contrib/auth/models.py#L225-404), which is the release 1.4x. After that there has been a lot of changes to django package.

### database integrations

### deployment
- [a great deployment documentation for django server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Deployment)
- [deployment platforms](https://djangofriendly.com/index.html)

### django rest framework
- 

### integrations
- [django - react integration](https://alphacoder.xyz/dead-simple-react-django-setup/)

> my personal favourite is **heroku** which provide free deployment of single app, consider it to test personal project deployment.
