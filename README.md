would be adding links to different blogs that helped me out to understand some concepts of django.

### first step
make sure to go through the [django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/) before proceeding any further.

### the django bible
[Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/)

> Django documentaion is itself a great well documented documentation, to know everything about django. But why not use some help from the coummunity!!

### base layout

### User authentication
- [Implement multiple user types](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2018/01/18/how-to-implement-multiple-user-types-with-django.html)
- [Extend/change user model](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/07/22/how-to-extend-django-user-model.html)

### database integrations

### deployment
- [a great deployment documentation for django server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Deployment)

### django rest framework

### integrations
